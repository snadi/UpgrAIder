1. ```The full updated code snippet in a fenced code block```
```python
import networkx as nx

SG=nx.OrderedGraph()  # Should be nx.OrderedGraph() instead of nx.OrderedGraph()
SG.add_nodes_from("HelloWorld")
SG.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (3,4), (6,8)])
print(SG)
```

2. The update is needed to correct the typo in the class name `OrderedGraph` to `OrderedGraph`.
