Given the provided numbered reference information, decide if the provided code needs to be updated.
Focus only on updates that do not change the code's functionality and are related to outdated, deprecated, or non-existent APIs.
You must reply in the following exact numbered format.
1. ```The full updated code snippet in a fenced code block``` or an empty fenced code block if you don't want to update the code
2. Reason for update (if any)
3. List of reference numbers used (if any) to update the code. If none of the references below were useful, say 'No references used'

Provided code:

```
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])
matrix = nx.to_numpy_matrix(G)
print(matrix)
```

Provided reference information:


1. [#5723] nx.nx_pydot.* will be deprecated in the future if pydot isn't being actively maintained. Users are recommended to use pygraphviz instead.
2. [#5813] OrderedGraph and other Ordered classes are replaced by Graph because Python dicts (and thus networkx graphs) now maintain order.
3. The numpy.msort function is deprecated. Use np.sort(a, axis=0) instead.
4. The numpy.fastCopyAndTranspose function has been deprecated. Use the corresponding copy and transpose methods directly:  arr.T.copy() 
5. Object arrays in sparse matrices now raise an error.
6. Note that conversion between NumPy integers is unaffected, so that np.array(-1).astype(np.uint8) continues to work and use C integer overflow logic.  For negative values, it will also work to view the array: np.array(-1, dtype=np.int8).view(np.uint8). In some cases, using np.iinfo(np.uint8).max or val % 2**8 may also work well.
7. Previous behavior:  In [8]: pd.Series().index Out[8]: Index([], dtype='object')  In [9] pd.DataFrame().axes Out[9]: [Index([], dtype='object'), Index([], dtype='object')] 
8. Inexact indices into sparse matrices now raise an error.
9. DataFrame.values, DataFrame.to_numpy, DataFrame.xs, DataFrame.reindex, DataFrame.fillna, and DataFrame.replace no longer silently consolidate the underlying arrays; do df = df.copy() to ensure consolidation (49356)
10. DataFrame.values, DataFrame.to_numpy, DataFrame.xs, DataFrame.reindex, DataFrame.fillna, and DataFrame.replace no longer silently consolidate the underlying arrays; do df = df.copy() to ensure consolidation (49356)
11. When providing a list of columns of length one to DataFrame.groupby, the keys that are returned by iterating over the resulting DataFrameGroupBy object will now be tuples of length one (47761)
12. Removed deprecated Categorical.to_dense, use np.asarray(cat) instead (32639)
13. Removed the alias scipy.random for numpy.random.
14. The deprecation for the aliases np.object, np.bool, np.float, np.complex, np.str, and np.int is expired (introduces NumPy 1.20).  Some of these will now give a FutureWarning in addition to raising an error since they will be mapped to the NumPy scalars in the future.
15. Many of these did succeed before.  Such code was mainly useful for unsigned integers with negative values such as np.uint8(-1) giving np.iinfo(np.uint8).max.
16. Deprecated the __array_wrap__ method of DataFrame and Series, rely on standard numpy ufuncs instead (45451)
17. Deprecated the __array_wrap__ method of DataFrame and Series, rely on standard numpy ufuncs instead (45451)
18. Multidimensional indexing with non-tuple values is not allowed.  Previously, code such as arr[ind] where ind = [[0, 1], [0, 1]] produced a FutureWarning and was interpreted as a multidimensional index (i.e., arr[tuple(ind)]). Now this example is treated like an array index over a single dimension (arr[array(ind)]).  Multidimensional indexing with anything but a tuple was deprecated in NumPy 1.15.
19. The underlying C function PyArray_CopyAndTranspose has also been deprecated from the NumPy C-API.
20. Enforced disallowing indexing on a Index or positional indexing on a Series producing multi-dimensional objects e.g. obj[:, None], convert to numpy before indexing instead (35141)
21. numpy.distutils has been deprecated, as a result of distutils itself being deprecated. It will not be present in NumPy for Python >= 3.12, and will be removed completely 2 years after the release of Python 3.12 For more details, see distutils-status-migration.
