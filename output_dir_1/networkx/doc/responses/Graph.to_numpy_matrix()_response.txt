1. ```The full updated code snippet in a fenced code block```
```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
matrix = nx.to_numpy_array(G)
print(matrix)
```
2. The `nx.to_numpy_matrix` function is deprecated. It should be replaced with `nx.to_numpy_array`.
