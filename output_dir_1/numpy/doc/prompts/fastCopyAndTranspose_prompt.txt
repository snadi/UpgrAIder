Given the provided numbered reference information, decide if the provided code needs to be updated.
Focus only on updates that do not change the code's functionality and are related to outdated, deprecated, or non-existent APIs.
You must reply in the following exact numbered format.
1. ```The full updated code snippet in a fenced code block``` or an empty fenced code block if you don't want to update the code
2. Reason for update (if any)
3. List of reference numbers used (if any) to update the code. If none of the references below were useful, say 'No references used'

Provided code:

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array(2)
b = np.fastCopyAndTranspose(a)
print(b)
```

Provided reference information:


1. The numpy.fastCopyAndTranspose function has been deprecated. Use the corresponding copy and transpose methods directly:  arr.T.copy() 
2. The numpy.msort function is deprecated. Use np.sort(a, axis=0) instead.
3. The underlying C function PyArray_CopyAndTranspose has also been deprecated from the NumPy C-API.
4. Note that conversion between NumPy integers is unaffected, so that np.array(-1).astype(np.uint8) continues to work and use C integer overflow logic.  For negative values, it will also work to view the array: np.array(-1, dtype=np.int8).view(np.uint8). In some cases, using np.iinfo(np.uint8).max or val % 2**8 may also work well.
5. DataFrame.values, DataFrame.to_numpy, DataFrame.xs, DataFrame.reindex, DataFrame.fillna, and DataFrame.replace no longer silently consolidate the underlying arrays; do df = df.copy() to ensure consolidation (49356)
6. DataFrame.values, DataFrame.to_numpy, DataFrame.xs, DataFrame.reindex, DataFrame.fillna, and DataFrame.replace no longer silently consolidate the underlying arrays; do df = df.copy() to ensure consolidation (49356)
7. Changed behavior of Index.ravel to return a view on the original Index instead of a np.ndarray (36900)
8. Object arrays in sparse matrices now raise an error.
9. Removed the alias scipy.random for numpy.random.
10. Changing to a dtype of different size in F-contiguous arrays is no longer permitted. Deprecated since Numpy 1.11.0. See below for an extended explanation of the effects of this change.
11. The Series and DataFrame constructors will now return a shallow copy (i.e. share data, but not attributes) when passed a Series and DataFrame, respectively, and with the default of copy=False (and if no other keyword triggers a copy). Previously, the new Series or DataFrame would share the index attribute (e.g. df.index = ... would also update the index of the parent or child) (49523)
12. The Series and DataFrame constructors will now return a shallow copy (i.e. share data, but not attributes) when passed a Series and DataFrame, respectively, and with the default of copy=False (and if no other keyword triggers a copy). Previously, the new Series or DataFrame would share the index attribute (e.g. df.index = ... would also update the index of the parent or child) (49523)
13. Across the DataFrame, .DataFrameGroupBy, and .Resampler operations such as min, sum, and idxmax, the default value of the numeric_only argument, if it exists at all, was inconsistent. Furthermore, operations with the default value None can lead to surprising results. (46560)  In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["x", "y"]})  In [2]: # Reading the next line without knowing the contents of df, one would         # expect the result to contain the products for both columns a and b.         df[["a", "b"]].prod() Out[2]: a    2 dtype: int64 
14. Creating a new DataFrame using a full slice on both axes with ~DataFrame.loc or ~DataFrame.iloc (thus, df.loc[:, :] or df.iloc[:, :]) now returns a new DataFrame (shallow copy) instead of the original DataFrame, consistent with other methods to get a full slice (for example df.loc[:] or df[:]) (49469)
15. Creating a new DataFrame using a full slice on both axes with ~DataFrame.loc or ~DataFrame.iloc (thus, df.loc[:, :] or df.iloc[:,
