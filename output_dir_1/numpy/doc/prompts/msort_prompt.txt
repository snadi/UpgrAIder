Given the provided numbered reference information, decide if the provided code needs to be updated.
Focus only on updates that do not change the code's functionality and are related to outdated, deprecated, or non-existent APIs.
You must reply in the following exact numbered format.
1. ```The full updated code snippet in a fenced code block``` or an empty fenced code block if you don't want to update the code
2. Reason for update (if any)
3. List of reference numbers used (if any) to update the code. If none of the references below were useful, say 'No references used'

Provided code:

```
import numpy as np

myArray = np.array([[0.434, 0.768, 0.54900530],
                    [0.36211, 0.3784, 0.2415],
                    [0.258, 0.52929049, 0.39172155]])

sorted = np.msort(myArray)

print(f"Min element is {sorted[0][0]}")


```

Provided reference information:


1. The numpy.msort function is deprecated. Use np.sort(a, axis=0) instead.
2. The mini() method of np.ma.MaskedArray has been removed. Use either np.ma.MaskedArray.min() or np.ma.minimum.reduce().
3. The mini() method of np.ma.MaskedArray has been removed. Use either np.ma.MaskedArray.min() or np.ma.minimum.reduce(). 
4. The single-argument form of np.ma.minimum and np.ma.maximum has been removed. Use np.ma.minimum.reduce() or np.ma.maximum.reduce() instead.
5. The single-argument form of np.ma.minimum and np.ma.maximum has been removed. Use np.ma.minimum.reduce() or np.ma.maximum.reduce() instead. (gh-22228) 
6. Removed the alias scipy.random for numpy.random.
7. For example:  In [3]: ser[2:4] Out[3]: 5    3 7    4 dtype: int64 
8. The scalar type aliases ending in a 0 bit size: np.object0, np.str0, np.bytes0, np.void0, np.int0, np.uint0 as well as np.bool8 are now deprecated and will eventually be removed.
9. Many of these did succeed before.  Such code was mainly useful for unsigned integers with negative values such as np.uint8(-1) giving np.iinfo(np.uint8).max.
10. Bug in DataFrame.pivot_table with sort=False results in sorted index (17041)
11. Note that conversion between NumPy integers is unaffected, so that np.array(-1).astype(np.uint8) continues to work and use C integer overflow logic.  For negative values, it will also work to view the array: np.array(-1, dtype=np.int8).view(np.uint8). In some cases, using np.iinfo(np.uint8).max or val % 2**8 may also work well.
12. Old behavior:  In [3]: ser[2:4] Out[3]: 5    3 7    4 dtype: int64 
13. Multidimensional indexing with non-tuple values is not allowed.  Previously, code such as arr[ind] where ind = [[0, 1], [0, 1]] produced a FutureWarning and was interpreted as a multidimensional index (i.e., arr[tuple(ind)]). Now this example is treated like an array index over a single dimension (arr[array(ind)]).  Multidimensional indexing with anything but a tuple was deprecated in NumPy 1.15.
14. Most of the time setting values with DataFrame.iloc attempts to set values inplace, only falling back to inserting a new array if necessary. There are some cases where this rule is not followed, for example when setting an entire column from an array with different dtype:  In [3]: df.iloc[:, 0] = new_prices In [4]: df.iloc[:, 0] Out[4]: book1    98 book2    99 Name: price, dtype: int64 In [5]: original_prices Out[5]: book1    11.1 book2    12.2 Name: price, float: 64 
15. Future behavior:  In [4]: ser.loc[2:4] Out[4]: 2    1 3    2 dtype: int64 
16. The numpy.fastCopyAndTranspose function has been deprecated. Use the corresponding copy and transpose methods directly:  arr.T.copy() 
17. Changed behavior of Index.ravel to return a view on the original Index instead of a np.ndarray (36900)
18. scipy.spatial.distance now enforces that the input vectors are one-dimensional.
19. Attempting a conversion from a Python integer to a NumPy value will now always check whether the result can be represented by NumPy.  This means the following examples will fail in the future and give a DeprecationWarning now:  np.uint8(-1) np.array([3000], dtype=np.int8) 
20. numpy.distutils has been deprecated, as a result of distutils itself being deprecated. It will not be present in NumPy for Python >= 3.12, and will be removed completely 2 years after the release of Python 3.12
